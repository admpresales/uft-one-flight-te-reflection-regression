# uft-one-flight-te-reflection-regression

This script runs a terminal emulation script against the Mercury 2000 TE emulator using Reflection TE and iterates through creating, viewing and deleting flight reservations.

Note: On a newly downloaded copy of NimbusClient, the Terminal Emulator is configured to run against Rumba. This is the UFT default. But this test runs against Reflection, which is intalled on client. To run correctly, go to Tools->Options->GUI Testing->Terminal Emulator, and select Reflection in the Emulator ComboBox
